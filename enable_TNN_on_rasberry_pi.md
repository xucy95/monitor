Tflite take ~800ms per frame to detect, So I want to try TNN for a faster inferece.
However it seems that TNN has no ready model for detection.
Converting need cuda installed, run TNN on Rasberry pi need a higher version GCC(https://bitbucket.org/sol_prog/raspberry-pi-gcc-binary.git), ...
 
These things stop me investing more, I dont want to pay too much time on it.
 
I will tolerate tflite with 800ms per frame. Maybe some day I will re-install a 64bit os to refresh 800ms to 400ms.
